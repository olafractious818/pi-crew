# pi-crew

Non-blocking subagent orchestration for [pi](https://pi.dev). Spawn isolated agents that work in parallel while your main session stays interactive. Results are delivered back as steering messages when done.

## Install

```bash
pi install @melihmucuk/pi-crew
```

## How It Works

pi-crew adds four tools and one command to your pi session:

### `crew_list`

Lists available agent definitions and currently running agents.

### `crew_spawn`

Spawns an agent in an isolated session. The agent runs in the background with its own context window, tools, and skills. When it finishes, the result is delivered to your main session as a steering message that triggers a new turn.

```
"spawn scout and find all API endpoints and their authentication methods"
```

### `crew_respond`

Sends a follow-up message to an interactive agent that is waiting for a response. Interactive agents stay alive after their initial response, allowing multi-turn conversations.

```
"respond to planner-a1b2 with: yes, use the existing auth middleware"
```

### `crew_done`

Closes an interactive agent session when you no longer need it. This disposes the session and frees memory.

```
"close planner-a1b2, the plan looks good"
```

### `/crew-abort`

Aborts a running agent. Supports tab completion for agent IDs.

## Bundled Agents

pi-crew ships with five agent definitions that cover common workflows:

| Agent                | Purpose                                                                                                                  | Tools                      | Model             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **scout**            | Investigates codebase and returns structured findings. Read-only. Use before planning or implementing to gather context. | read, grep, find, ls, bash | claude-haiku-4-5  |
| **planner**          | Analyzes requirements and produces a step-by-step implementation plan. Read-only. Does not write code. Interactive.       | read, grep, find, ls, bash | gpt-5.4           |
| **code-reviewer**    | Reviews code changes for bugs, security issues, and correctness. Read-only. Does not fix issues.                         | read, grep, find, ls, bash | gpt-5.4           |
| **quality-reviewer** | Reviews code structure for maintainability, duplication, and complexity. Read-only. Does not look for bugs.              | read, grep, find, ls, bash | gpt-5.4           |
| **worker**           | Implements code changes, fixes, and refactors autonomously. Has full read-write access to the codebase.                  | all                        | claude-sonnet-4-6 |

## Custom Agents

Create `.md` files in `~/.pi/agent/agents/` with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: my-agent
description: What this agent does
model: anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5
thinking: medium
tools: read, grep, find, ls, bash
skills: skill-1, skill-2
---

Your system prompt goes here. This is the body of the markdown file.

The agent will follow these instructions when executing tasks.
```

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field         | Required | Description                                                                                     |
| ------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`        | yes      | Agent identifier. No whitespace, use hyphens.                                                   |
| `description` | yes      | Shown in `crew_list` output.                                                                    |
| `model`       | no       | `provider/model-id` format (e.g., `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5`). Falls back to session default. |
| `thinking`    | no       | Thinking level: `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`.                             |
| `tools`       | no       | Comma-separated list: `read`, `bash`, `edit`, `write`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`. Omit for all.      |
| `skills`      | no       | Comma-separated skill names (e.g., `ast-grep`). Omit for all.                                   |
| `compaction`  | no       | Enable context compaction. Defaults to `true`.                                                  |
| `interactive` | no       | Keep session alive after response for multi-turn conversations. Defaults to `false`.            |

## Status Widget

When agents are running, a live status widget appears in the TUI showing each agent's ID, model, turn count, and context token usage.

```
⠹ scout-a1b2 (claude-haiku-4-5) · turn 3 · 12.5k ctx
⠸ worker-c3d4 (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) · turn 7 · 45.2k ctx
⏳ planner-e5f6 (gpt-5.4) · turn 2 · 8.3k ctx
```

Interactive agents waiting for a response show a ⏳ icon instead of a spinner.
