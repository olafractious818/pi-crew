# pi-crew

Non-blocking subagent orchestration for [pi](https://pi.dev). Spawn isolated subagents that work in parallel while your current session stays interactive. Results are delivered back to the session that spawned them as steering messages when done.

## Install

```bash
pi install @melihmucuk/pi-crew
```

This installs the extension, bundled prompt template, and bundled subagent definitions. Bundled subagents are automatically discovered and ready to use without any extra setup.

## Architecture

For an implementation-grounded description of runtime behavior, ownership rules, delivery semantics, and integration points, see [docs/architecture.md](./docs/architecture.md).

## How It Works

pi-crew adds five tools, one command, and one bundled prompt template to your pi session.

### `crew_list`

Lists available subagent definitions and active subagents owned by the current session.

### `crew_spawn`

Spawns a subagent in an isolated session. The subagent runs in the background with its own context window, tools, and skills. When it finishes, the result is delivered to the session that spawned it as a steering message that triggers a new turn. If that session is not active, the result is queued until you switch back to it.

```
"spawn scout and find all API endpoints and their authentication methods"
```

### `crew_abort`

Aborts one, many, or all active subagents owned by the current session.

Supported modes:

- single: `subagent_id`
- multiple: `subagent_ids`
- all active in current session: `all: true`

```
"abort scout-a1b2"
"abort scout-a1b2 and worker-c3d4"
"abort all active subagents"
```

Tool-triggered aborts are reported back as steering messages with the reason `Aborted by tool request`.

### `crew_respond`

Sends a follow-up message to an interactive subagent owned by the current session that is waiting for a response. Interactive subagents stay alive after their initial response, allowing multi-turn conversations.

```
"respond to planner-a1b2 with: yes, use the existing auth middleware"
```

### `crew_done`

Closes an interactive subagent session owned by the current session when you no longer need it. This disposes the session and frees memory.

```
"close planner-a1b2, the plan looks good"
```

### `/pi-crew:abort`

Aborts a running subagent. Supports tab completion for subagent IDs.
Unlike the `crew_abort` tool, this command is intentionally unrestricted and works as an emergency escape hatch across sessions.

### `/pi-crew:review`

Expands a bundled prompt template that orchestrates parallel code and quality reviews.
Use it to review recent commits, staged changes, unstaged changes, and untracked files with `code-reviewer` and `quality-reviewer`, then merge both results into one report.

Note: This prompt requires the `code-reviewer` and `quality-reviewer` subagent definitions. These are included as bundled subagents and work out of the box.

## Bundled Subagents

pi-crew ships with five subagent definitions that cover common workflows:

| Subagent             | Purpose                                                                                                                  | Tools                      | Model                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **scout**            | Investigates codebase and returns structured findings. Read-only. Use before planning or implementing to gather context. | read, grep, find, ls, bash | anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5  |
| **planner**          | Analyzes requirements and produces a step-by-step implementation plan. Read-only. Does not write code. Interactive.      | read, grep, find, ls, bash | openai-codex/gpt-5.4        |
| **code-reviewer**    | Reviews code changes for bugs, security issues, and correctness. Read-only. Does not fix issues.                         | read, grep, find, ls, bash | openai-codex/gpt-5.4        |
| **quality-reviewer** | Reviews code structure for maintainability, duplication, and complexity. Read-only. Does not look for bugs.              | read, grep, find, ls, bash | openai-codex/gpt-5.4        |
| **worker**           | Implements code changes, fixes, and refactors autonomously. Has full read-write access to the codebase.                  | all                        | anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6 |

Read-only bundled subagents still keep `bash` for inspection workflows like `git` and `ast-grep`. This is an instruction-level contract, not a sandbox boundary.

## Subagent Discovery

Subagent definitions are discovered from three locations, in priority order:

1. **Project**: `<cwd>/.pi/agents/*.md`
2. **User global**: `~/.pi/agent/agents/*.md`
3. **Bundled**: shipped with this package

When multiple sources define a subagent with the same `name`, the higher-priority source wins. This lets you override any bundled subagent by placing a file with the same name in your project or user directory.

## Custom Subagents

Create `.md` files in `<cwd>/.pi/agents/` (project-level) or `~/.pi/agent/agents/` (global) with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: my-subagent
description: What this subagent does
model: anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5
thinking: medium
tools: read, grep, find, ls, bash
skills: skill-1, skill-2
---

Your system prompt goes here. This is the body of the markdown file.

The subagent will follow these instructions when executing tasks.
```

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field         | Required | Description                                                                                                          |
| ------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`        | yes      | Subagent identifier. No whitespace, use hyphens.                                                                     |
| `description` | yes      | Shown in `crew_list` output.                                                                                         |
| `model`       | no       | `provider/model-id` format (e.g., `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5`). Falls back to session default.                      |
| `thinking`    | no       | Thinking level: `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`.                                                  |
| `tools`       | no       | Comma-separated list: `read`, `bash`, `edit`, `write`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`. Omit for all, use empty value for none. |
| `skills`      | no       | Comma-separated skill names (e.g., `ast-grep`). Omit for all, use empty value for none.                              |
| `compaction`  | no       | Enable context compaction. Defaults to `true`.                                                                       |
| `interactive` | no       | Keep session alive after response for multi-turn conversations. Defaults to `false`.                                 |

## Subagent Overrides via JSON

You can override selected frontmatter fields without editing the `.md` definition files.

Config locations:

- Global: `~/.pi/agent/pi-crew.json`
- Project: `<cwd>/.pi/pi-crew.json`

Project config overrides global config. Only these fields are overridable:

- `model`
- `thinking`
- `tools`
- `skills`
- `compaction`
- `interactive`

`name` and `description` cannot be overridden.

Example:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "scout": {
      "model": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5",
      "tools": ["read", "bash"],
      "interactive": false
    },
    "planner": {
      "thinking": "high"
    }
  }
}
```

Override values replace the matching frontmatter fields for the named subagent after discovery. Unknown subagent names and invalid override values are ignored with warnings in `crew_list` output.

## Status Widget

When the current session owns active subagents, a live status widget appears in the TUI for that session, showing each subagent's ID, model, turn count, and context token usage.

```
⠹ scout-a1b2 (claude-haiku-4-5) · turn 3 · 12.5k ctx
⠸ worker-c3d4 (claude-sonnet-4-6) · turn 7 · 45.2k ctx
⏳ planner-e5f6 (gpt-5.4) · turn 2 · 8.3k ctx
```

Interactive subagents waiting for a response show a ⏳ icon instead of a spinner.
